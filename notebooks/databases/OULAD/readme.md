OULAD contains anonymized records of students enrolled in seven different courses over multiple academic presentations. It combines demographic information (such as age band, gender, highest education level, and disability status), assessment results (such as scores, submission dates, weight of assessments, etc.), and activity logs from the universityâ€™s Virtual Learning Environment (VLE). These logs include clickstream data that reflect student engagement.
